# UFO
## Analysis
This project built a website and tracking system that allows users to monitor UFO sightings around the world. It utilizes filter functions in JavaScript that sifts through all the available data making it easily accessible for users. Creating this website tested JS and html knowledge. 
## Results
In order to search for specific results in the table, the user must input the locations they are searching for. The website will then filter through the data looking for attributes matching the input. It will continue looping through all the data until all the criteria inputted by the user are met. It does so with a filter setting. The filtered data will then be shown to the user. The filtering process will not take long and the results will appear if there are matching attributes.
## Summary 
A drawback of the webpage is how specific the results have to be. The inputs for the search will have to match exactly what the data is. If there is a misspell it will not recognize that. I would recommend building a section that can autofull the search bar in case there is an incorrect spelling. Another recommendation would be to clean the webpage by making the data visible in a scroll-through table. This makes the entire data set fit into one screen rather than have to leave the search bar while sifting through the table.
